# Pang

this is my recreation of the arcade pang game (also known as [Buster Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Bros.)) for the motorola science cup 2021

you can find gameplay of the original game [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyhP6uLk9Fg)

for this project I chose C++ because for me it's the easiest and most fun language to write games in

# Build
On Linux:
```
cd project_dir
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
cmake --build .
```
On Windows: 
idk man the commands above should work maybe??
I tried it and cmake was kinda broken go figure it out yourself

On MacOS:
XdXdXdXdXdXd

# Play

Releases: just download it you'll figure it out

Manual build: put the binary in the same folder as the .dll / .so / whatever files and the res folder and you should be ready to go

# What next
nothing 

I probably won't continue this project
if you want to fork it but I don't recommend it since getting through the spaghetti jungle will take years
