~~- level parser:~~
	~~- levels stored (in the balls) probably in just plain txt unless I find something better~~
	- I guess that's it? Idk man I might make something like to scale the level to fit into the screen if it's too big but I can also just make levels that are just the right size and it would be ok

- fix player movement cause right now it's silly af ðŸ’€

- add jumping

- balls (funny)

- then when balls are done add some weapons
